## Abstract
The Library Management System (LMS) is a software solution designed to automate and streamline library operations for both administrators and users. Its primary goal is to efficiently manage books, members, and borrowing/returning activities while maintaining accuracy and reducing manual workload. the system provides features such as:
*Book catalog management
*User/member registration
*Borrowing and returning of books
*Tracking overdue books and penalties
*Search and filtering of resources
By digitizing these operations, the LMS enhances accessibility, improves the user experience, and helps library staff manage resources more effectively. This project can be adapted to different types of libraries, from small community libraries to large academic institutions.
